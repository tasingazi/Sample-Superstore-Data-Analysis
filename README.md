# Profit Maximization Strategies for Technology Sales at Sample Superstore

## Overview
This project analyzes sales and profit trends for technology products at Sample Superstore to identify strategies for maximizing profitability. The analysis was conducted using **Tableau** and **Excel**, with a focus on data visualization and storytelling.

## Tools Used
- Tableau
- Excel
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## Key Insights
1. **Sales vs. Profit**: While sales increased from $494K in 2020 to $694K in 2023, profit margins did not grow proportionally.
2. **Discount Impact**: High discounts (e.g., 832.31 for the Consumer segment) drove sales but eroded profits.
3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Rising COGS contributed to shrinking profit margins.
4. **Product Performance**: Some categories (e.g., Paper) were consistently profitable, while others (e.g., Binders) incurred losses.

## Recommendations
1. **Optimize Discounts**: Reduce excessive discounts, especially in the Consumer segment, to improve profitability.
2. **Focus on High-Margin Products**: Prioritize sales of high-margin items like Paper and Machines.
3. **Cost Control**: Implement measures to reduce COGS, such as renegotiating supplier contracts or optimizing inventory management.
